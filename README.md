#notes
  tests are very simplistics.
  only core functionality covered in unit contests
  only one query tested in integration tests
  more test should be written for integration - to test exceptions, errors, edge cases
  also integration tests should cover scenarious - what data appears on /spaceship endpoint after calls to /path endpoint
